# Not a quiche lorraine

I'm a young engineer passionnate about cloud technologies in general. Quite polyvalent, I try to solve problems requiring a large skillset.

In my day to day life, I work on Dev and DevOps tasks like microservices development, container management, GitOps, CI/CD, ..., and more precisely I use :
* Golang
* Kubernetes
* Terraform
* Linux
* Gitlab CI
* ArgoCD
* and other tools but let's not make it too boring

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a solution to help people manage their vegetables plantation.
My last project was about organizing parties with the help of microservices. This project is called Ricardo and you will find some related projects below.
