# Not a quiche lorraine

I'm a young engineer passionnate about cloud technologies in general. Quite polyvalent, I try to solve problems requiring a large skillset.
Graduated at ENSICAEN in computer science with e-Payments additionnal courses, I'm currently working for Dejamobile, the french leader in mobile payment solutions (HCE, SE, SoftPOS, ...).

I am a novice in the open-source community but want to start contributing to projects I believe will help improve our already beautiful cloud computing landscape.

Feel free to contact me ! Also available on [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~018ec62283e3c44477).

## Technologies
In my day to day life, I mostly work on these following concepts :
* Container orchestration
* GitOps
* Infrastruce as Code
* Microservices development
* A bit of work related to PCI-DSS

And more precisely :
* Golang
* Kubernetes
* Terraform
* Linux
* Gitlab CI
* ArgoCD
* and other tools but let's not make it too boring


## Projects 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on : something secret.

:beers: My last project was about organizing parties with the help of microservices. This project is called Ricardo and you will find some related projects below.
